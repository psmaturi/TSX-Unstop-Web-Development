        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am Pardha Saradhi, a second-year B.Tech student at SRM University in Andhra Pradesh with a strong interest in computer science and engineering. I constantly work to improve my technical abilities and knowledge since I have a strong interest in software development and cutting-edge technology. I like working on projects that test my analytical and creative thinking as well as tackling challenging difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my studies, I take part in cooperative team projects and coding contests to increase my real-world experience. I can't wait to put what I've learned to use in practical situations and make a valuable contribution to the tech sector.
